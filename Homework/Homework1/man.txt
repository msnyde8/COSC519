NAME
       mount - mount a filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mount [-lhV]

       mount -a [-fFnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-O optlist]

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-o option[,option]...]  device|dir

       mount [-fnrsvw] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir

DESCRIPTION
       All  files  accessible in a Unix system are arranged in one big tree, the
       file hierarchy, rooted at /.  These files can be spread out over  several
       devices.  The mount command serves to attach the filesystem found on some
       device to the big file  tree.  Conversely,  the  umount(8)  command  will
       detach it again.

       The standard form of the mount command, is

              mount -t type device dir

       This  tells the kernel to attach the filesystem found on device (which is
       of type type) at the directory dir.  The previous contents (if  any)  and
